Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, Flask (for web app)

ðŸ“‚ Project Components:
Text Preprocessing

Tokenization

Stop-word removal

Sentence segmentation

Summarization Techniques

Extractive Summarization: Using algorithms like TextRank.

Abstractive Summarization: Using pre-trained models like:

BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer)

T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)

Model Integration
